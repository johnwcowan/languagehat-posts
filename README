Make sure all the files in this repo are executable.  Also make sure that
wget, sed, grep, head, sort, cut, curl, perl (version 5) are available.

To create or recreate the "Commented-On Language Hat Posts" file,
execute the `recreate` script.

To keep it updated, run `snarf` from cron.  I run it every minute, but
you can run it less often if you like.  However, you will lose updates
if there are more than 10 new comments in the time between runs.
